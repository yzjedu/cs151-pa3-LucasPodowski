# Reflection Document

* Full Name :  Lucas Podowski
* Student ID:  001907164

Objective:  
* Practice against bad user input, decision-making, designing and implementing functions, looping, and creativity  
Procedure  
* I split up the problem into functions then put them all together to solve the problem
* explored functions, looping, error checking, and tried to be creative  
Results: 
* The code worked
* I did not make test cases  
Reflection:
* My biggest challenge was figuring out how to set the spaces and lines right for the ASCII designs
* I followed the 3 rules of programing by first planning out how I would separate the functions into tasks, 
then I coded them tested
* I figured out how to set the spaces by looking it up on Google and finding """ being used in a stack overflow post
* I became better at utilizing functions
* I think I did learn what was to be expected
* Working by myself made planning easier as I did not have to convey my ideas to someone else.
